    <h1>Possible Portrait Series</h1>
    <p>Portrait series are non-speacial portraits, they're all summed up in one page in the Identity V Fandom,
        see
        <a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Colorful_Memory">the colorful memory series' page</a> for
        reference.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Colorful_Memory">Colorful Memory</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Black-and-White_(Portrait)">Black and White</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that the API is flexible with the <code>:series</code> query, meaning that you don't have to write
        it
        the way the fandom requires you to.
        <br>For instance, using "Black_and_white" is enough instead of "Black-and-White_(Portrait)"
